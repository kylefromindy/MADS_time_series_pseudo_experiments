1. Slides are pre-rendered as `.html` documents in the `/slides` directory. The files are interactive and can be viewed in any modern-ish web browser

1. The `0 - Setup.ipynb` notebook has a cell that should install all required Python packages to the current python environment. Who needs a `requirements.txt` when you have cell magic?

    - Data is stored as `.parquet` files in the `/data` directory

    - For transparency & extendability, that notebook includes all code required to filter and transform the original data sets into the `.parquet` files used by the actual example notebooks
